_Package to detect and track floating ice sheets in the ocean from video frames_


Currently, there are 4 versions in progress:
1. statistical tracker:
   automatically detects ice floe contours, saves them as objects and inits a tracker on it
   in every next step it assigns and thus updates known objects or creates new
   works good so far. Some refinement could be made
   Thresholds calibrated with a video and not the correct footage
2. Roid tracker:
   simplest approach
   user selects a roid, software detects elements and user selects the correct one
   user selects roid on a future roid, same procedure and the program calculates
   drift direction and speed
3. Line tracker:
   kind of manuel statistical tracker
   useful if no little seperated ice floes are visible
   can thus track huge floes drifting through the FOV
   the user draws a line on first frame which should cover a contour segmet of
   some ice floe
   the software detects and assigns the correct in-image contour to the drawn line
   on future frames detects a similar contour segment and so tracks this drawn line
4. Mixture of Roid and Line tracker 


## ToDo

- style and structure
- make line tracker more robust
      - and add prediction/reduction of next frame area to make more robust
- bilder mit s√§ttigung verfeinern?!
- aktuelle version fertig mit anzeigen in einzelnen frames etc
    - nochmal mit contour_binary input testen
